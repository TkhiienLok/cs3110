The functions in [Excercises.ml](Exersices.ml) can be run in the OCaml toplevel (The docs https://ocaml.org/docs/toplevel-introduction)

To run toplevel use utop command:

```bash
utop
```

To import file run in utop:

```
#use "Exercises.ml";;
```

Now you can call functions from the [Excercises.ml](Exersices.ml)

To quit utop press Ctrl-D (end of file) or enter #quit;;

```
#quit
```
